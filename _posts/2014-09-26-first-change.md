<img src="/assets/images/2493604415_230048038b_b_werewolf.jpg">Raised by the pack, we didn't know about the Change util it happened to my friend Brown Ear. Running in the woods, four-feet, paws and fur was all we pups had ever known. Brown Ear stopped during our moonlit run and howled before collapsing in a writhing tangle of fur and limbs. When he stopped, I padded over and nudged him with my snout. He rolled over, fur-less yet sweating, looked at me with blue eyes and a flat face and said "Your turn, Matt."
