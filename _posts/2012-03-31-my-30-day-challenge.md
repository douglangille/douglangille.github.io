So here's mine: starting today for the next 30 days, I have banished all flour and added-sugar from my diet. It's not quite Paleo, but it's a big enough step in that direction for me at this time.

I've had a bout of very painful gout a couple of years ago and am currently taking cholesterol medication. I have signs of fatty infiltration in my liver and diabetes is peppered throughout my family. I'm 300 pounds. Shit got a little more real when I had to have a sizeable lipoma removed from my neck this winter.

While I've had a lot of (temporary) success with Weight Watchers over the years, last year's go-around was hit-and-miss. It's all me of course --- I can't blame the program (although the changes to the plan are problematic). I did drop 25 pounds and have kept it off. Still, when the renewal came up at the start of March, I begged off.

I spent March reflecting about my plateau, both the physical one and the psycho-emotional one. My conclusion is that I should do something different and take true ownership of my health. I did some research and a lot of thinking. I surmised that a large component of my physical struggle could easily be about glycemic load. I think my liver is speaking to me. It's time I listened.

However, my biggest takeaway is that I need to spend more time working on establishing good habits and minimizing bad ones. Chasing weight-loss goals and leaning on The Program seems too much like an act of misplaced faith. The excuses are baked in --- I should know.

That brings me to my April 30 Day Challenge. This is an approach based on sound facts and one that I can own. It's about habit-forming, plain and simple. What speaks to me about it is that it's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development" target="_blank">Agile</a> --- focused, iterative and with a progressive continual pattern of successes baked in. I like this.

I'm measuring not by the scale, but by three stories that will be true at the end of this 30 day sprint:

<ul>
  <li>When I'm hungry I eat real food and am satisfied. I'm off the insulin roller-coaster.</li>
  <li>I am no longer exhausted by my day --- I am energised and productive.</li>
  <li>I sleep soundly and wake feeling refreshed and ready to take on whatever the day brings.</li>
</ul>

To measure progress, I'm recording my food intake and activities as well as how I'm feeling on a daily basis.

Aside from being public about my goals, I've also partnered with several like-minded colleagues at work who have their own 30 Day Challenges. The shared accountability and support will be a source of strength. My wife and family are also very supportive of my approach.

This will be a good month.
