<ul>
  <li>Weight: 234 lbs</li>
  <li>Neck: 16"</li>
  <li>Navel: 43"</li>
  <li>Waist: 42"</li>
  <li>Hips: 45"</li>
  <li>Body Fat: 33.23%</li>
</ul>

That's a loss of 5 lbs and a net gain of 2" resulting in a +1.25% in estimated body fat. I'll take the weight loss and accept the change in geometry --- it's a delta within the 1-3% error range.

I'm actually quite pleased with the results of <a href="http://blog.douglangille.ca/post/39437281774/the-clock-is-running-make-the-most-of-today-time">January's commitments</a> after gaining 2 pounds during the candy season of Halloween through New Years.

I didn't focus on progress so much as daily compliance with my eating strategy. That worked well. Especially during the last two weeks --- I stayed within my caloric and macro-nutrient tolerances.

I struggled with establishing a consistent routine for the circuit training this month. It's a work in progress. I did indeed tweak it:

<ul>
  <li>10 burpees</li>
  <li>10 lunges per side</li>
  <li>15 second horizontal plank</li>
  <li>15 dumbell rows per side</li>
</ul>

I can get 2 or 3 sets in while making breakfast. I need to be doing 3 or 4. I also need to add more weight to the DB rows as soon as I can squeeze out a few bucks. The 4L water jug works great, but 10 lbs is clearly not enough. Body-weight rows / inverted push-ups are not even on the table yet let alone an actual pull-up. I did pick up a pull-up bar --- I can hang from it quite nicely. Quite humbling. Oh well. We all need <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">dreams</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">fantasies</span> goals. I will continue my hero-training. <a href="http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret">I will channel Jerry Seinfeld to enhance the habit</a>.

Now, walking was a kick-ass win this month. I crossed that miserable bridge nearly every workday --- about 5 km. I logged a whopping 131 km in January. Booyah!

I'm on track in training for the Bluenose Run on Victoria Day weekend. I have until the end of February to register. I feel quite confident about the 10k. Perhaps I'll commit to the 21k jaunt instead. See how the month goes as I add walk/run intervals to my regime.

The real surprise of the month has been in writing. The original plan was to come up with a weekly blogging habit. I broke it out by topic category and such. The goal was to exercise my writing muscle in preparation for NaNoWriMo in November.

Then I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.writersdigest.com/prompts">Writers Digest's creative prompts</a>. It's more <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5939374/a-better-way-to-practice">deliberate practice</a> and quite fun. "<a href="http://blog.douglangille.ca/tagged/stormy-night/chrono">Stormy Night</a>" is taking a bit of a life of its own.

I still have a stack of other blog ideas that are percolating.

To sum up, this month's commitments are to:

<ul>
  <li>maintain strong Primal Blueprint eating compliance,</li>
  <li>add walk/run interval training to the regimen,</li>
  <li>do 3-4 circuits every frickin' frackin' day, and</li>
  <li>continue with weekly installents of Stormy Night</li>
</ul>

By next month's update, I'll have registered for the Bluenose.
