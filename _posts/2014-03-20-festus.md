<img src="/assets/images/14781572691_16b458ec9d_b.jpg">You see, Sheriff. I was taking a shower at the Deadman's Falls after Festus pushed me in the dirt. Sure, there was a bout of fisticuffs, but nothing too crazy? Yes, I know he's a horse, but I've been lonely. Where's my pants? Yes, sir. Festus ate them.
