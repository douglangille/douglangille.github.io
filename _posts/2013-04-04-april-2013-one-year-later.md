<img src="/assets/images/2245362817_2cd6b263af_caveman.jpg">So this morning, I weigh 231 pounds. That's up one pound from last month. March sucked in many ways, and strict adherence to my plan was among them. But, hey ---

Life happens.

I do note that this month does indeed stand as a milestone, Since <a href="http://blog.douglangille.ca/post/36366700659/my-30-day-challenge">last April</a>, when I adopted the <a href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/primal-blueprint-101/">Primal Blueprint</a>, I've dropped 75 pounds. In less than two years, I've lost 100.

Most importantly, I've kept it off.

So, even though my rate of loss has stalled a bit and I can be frustrated, it is important for me to reflect and hold on to the WIN**.

What's next?

Easy. I'm going to live my life --- a healthy life. Adopting a primal/paleo lifestyle wasn't and isn't temporary. It's one of the lenses through which I approach life.

This month's challenge is pretty straight forward: use a half-hour of my lunch hours to structure my fitness work plan.

<ul>
  <li>Mondays: Yoga with Stefanie and the gang</li>
  <li>Tuesdays: Weights with Andre and Clint</li>
  <li>Wednesdays: Interval running with Andre and Clint</li>
  <li>Thursdays: Weights with Andre and Clint</li>
  <li>Fridays: Interval running with Andre and Clint</li>
</ul>

This is atop my existing habits of carb restriction, the 5k walk to work in the mornings and quick-n-dirty calisthenics while making breakfast.

I'm still working on my pull-ups. I have the bar mounted in the entrance to my laundry room, much to the peril of those taller than me. Every time I go there (which is often), I give it a go. It's irregular, but working for me.

I've also registered for the 10k <a href="http://bluenosemarathon.com/">Bluenose Run</a> on Victoria Day weekend. If I can stop rolling my ankle, it should be a fun event.

Oh, one more thing. I'm still doing my <a href="http://www.writersdigest.com/prompts">weekly writing</a> thing in preparation for my <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">novel-crafting effort this coming November</a>.
