This gag would play out perfectly. My papers were all laid out and askew to the point where there wasn't a straight line. My soda dripped along the side almost pointing to the many rings on my desk. I'd thrown my gym towel over the back of my monitor for good measure. But the piece-de-resistance was the trail of salt-and-pepper bits, leading to the offending torn packet and greasy burger wrapper. Yes, ol' Benny was perspiring for sure. Always with the perfect tie. Always with the orthogonally laid out notebook and pens for every meeting. Always with the three knock rule. And always with ratting us all out for every infraction. You betcha. It was good him sweat for a change.
