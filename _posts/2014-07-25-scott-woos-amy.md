"It's pretty easy to offer the impossible, Scott."

"But if I could, you know, I would."

"What about that star over there? Would you pluck that from the sky for me?"

"I'd do better, Amy. I'd make it rain stars."

"But would you respect me in the morning?"

"That depends. Will you be here when the sun rises?"

"Only if you kiss me like you promised."
