<img src="https://douglangille.github.io/assets/images/20091103-174603.jpg">Rhonda makes a mean split green pea soup. It's very tasty and always reminds me of a couple of jokes. The first one makes me giggle:

Big Brother to Little Brother: After everything I say, you say "Pea Green Soup," Okay?  
LB: Okay.  
BB: What did you have for breakfast?  
LB: Pea Green Soup.  
BB: What did you have for lunch?  
LB: Pea Green Soup.  
BB: What did you have for supper?  
LB: Pea Green Soup.  
BB: What did you do all night?  
LB: Pea Green Soup!

The other one is a little more subtle (though laugh-snorting soup through your nose can be messy):

Whats the difference between Roast Beef and Pea Soup?  
That anyone can ROAST BEEF, but no one can PEA SOUP.
