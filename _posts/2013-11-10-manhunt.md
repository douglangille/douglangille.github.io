Autumn air froze everything brittle. Rifles slung, hunters like these knew camouflage: sight, sound, smell. Deer, rabbit, even bear; forest ghosts masking chase. Quarry would overlook danger's pursuit with such skilled tactics.

Sun shone through canopy breaks, casting shadows. Light flashes, colored glimpses, hurried movement; signs of impending endgame.

The man in black turned to face his tormentors. He smiled triumphantly as weapons were raised. Trap sprung, prey turned predator enjoyed a view: deep pit, wooden stakes and two dead men.
