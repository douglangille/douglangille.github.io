Money was tight and my folks weren't getting along. It wasn't until I was well into my married years that I was able to relax and enjoy the time. These last couple years, with the girls gone, it's just been the two of us and our son. I expect this will be the last year he'll be home too. Recent Christmas mornings have been somewhat subdued, but with grandkids, the magic returns. I wouldn't have it any other way.
