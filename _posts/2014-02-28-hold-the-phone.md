"Yes, it is. How did you know? I called you?"

"Good. We've been expecting your call. Pack a small bag. You have 15 minutes."

"What the hell is going on?"

"The agents will explain. Hurry, Mr. Langille. You're in danger."

"I will do no such thing. Not until you tell me whats going on."

"Mr. Langille... Doug, the lottery win was engineered to determine the level of infiltration of the Opposition."

"You mean, I didn't win a trip?"

"Oh, you won a trip all right. Just not the one you were expecting. Get packing. 10 minutes. Hurry."
