"Bet you don't."

"I'll take that bet. Were you talking with Maggie today?"

"No. I take it, you were. What's up with her?"

"Ohhh... Nothing."

"Nothing, my ass. Did she lose her job? Again?"

"No, she's game-fully employed for the moment."

"What the hell does that mean?"

"Keep guessing, sweetheart."

"You're really frustrating, you know that?"

"That's why you love me."

"Okay, so give it up. What's going on with Maggie?"

"Nothing bad, I promise."

"Argh. You're driving me nuts, woman."

"Mission accomplished, 'grandpa'."
