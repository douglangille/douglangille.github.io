<img src="https://douglangille.github.io/assets/images/4125927607_0aa78d3a4f_b.jpg">Matted-hair and rotted teeth,  
 what evil danger lurks beneath?  
 Pointed talons and razor claw,  
 drags you into a gaping maw.  
 He hides in closets and under beds,  
 ripping, shredding, bloody red.  
 Lurking darkly behind the door,  
 what's that creaking on the floor?  
 Banging, scraping in the dark of night,  
 keeps the children awake in fright.
