<img src="https://douglangille.github.io/assets/images/5923105171_90007ff833_cat-mouse.jpg">Missy's moon shadow cast long, tail twitching in anticipation; the taste of freshly killed squirrel electrified her whiskers. She named her quarry Nemesis.

He crouched under the garden marigolds. The cat locked her radar on him, sharpened front toes splayed and hind quarters raised. Carmilla played witness from her web.

Costumed munchkins thundered up the walk, breaking the standoff. Missy sat and cleaned herself lazily while eying her objective. Nemesis kept wary but couldn't abandon his post without pilfering a treat.

The children left, satisfied with their haul. Smack! A candy apple fell unnoticed save the two combatants.

Show time!
