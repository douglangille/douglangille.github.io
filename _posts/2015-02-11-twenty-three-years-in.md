It's late at night and we lie in bed  
 Lost in thought, alone in mind  
 The heat of passion cooling soft  
 Drifting darkly, we are blind

We're not the same as once we were  
 Kids all grown and moved away  
 A yawning void longing to be filled  
 Threatening to speed our love's decay

Strange to each other and to ourselves  
 Fan the embers, kindle the flame  
 Time yet enough to imagine a life  
 Together our life to reclaim
