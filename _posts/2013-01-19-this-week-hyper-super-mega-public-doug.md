I also wanted to tighten up my regimen a bit. No better than to crank up the public accountability level to ELEVEN!

For the next 7 days, at the end of the day, I'll post a listing of everything I cram in my maw. I'll also breakout and explain some of the choices I make.

You'll also bear witness to my exercise foibles for shits, giggles and overall completeness.

Feel free to comment or ask questions on these posts. This'll be fun.
