I greeted him as best as my translator-matrix would allow, but I think it came out in error. The Human opened his mouth and displayed an alarming amount of blunt teeth. This fact confused me in that he was clearly a herbivorous species, yet wore vestments of a conquering species. Perhaps further study is warranted.
