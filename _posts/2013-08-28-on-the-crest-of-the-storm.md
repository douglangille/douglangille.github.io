<img src="https://douglangille.github.io/assets/images/a1bc99068ab8b46b_1280_lightning.jpg">thunderous dark skies  
 running through the autumn grass  
 into the dark wood

*I am the hunted. He does not stop, will not stop. I hear my name above the building storm. He's coming. I climb an ancient tree. It is warm. I draw from its strength and my knife hand quiets its tremble. I wait in the gloom, a wife and victim no longer.*

*My eyes narrow as I see him creeping through the brush, brandishing a hammer. There is no going back. It is quiet. Below me now, the smell of sweat and anger fill my mind with fear and something else. Hatred. There is no going back. It ends now. I drop from my perch and strike.*

lightning casts dark spells  
 violent blood soaks maple leaves  
 no one walks away
