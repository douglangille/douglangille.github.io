<img src="/assets/images/cobweb-449911_1280.jpg">"Oh, thank you, Spiderman!" I said as I wrapped my arms around my masked rescuer as we swung from building to building, moving ever closer to the ground.

The people below looked like ants. My hero said, "Uh, ma'am. I'm not Spiderman."

"No?" I asked, confused by his admission.

He set me on the ground. "You see, I kinda took a little too much radiation. It's addictive you see." He waved his extra limbs at me. "You can just call me Spider," he said as he turned to leave then stopped. "And you're welcome."
