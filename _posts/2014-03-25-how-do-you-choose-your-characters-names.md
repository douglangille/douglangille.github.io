Do you choose a character's name because it just sounds right or does it have to have meaning?

Is a strongman named Sampson and a betrayer named Cain?

Do you grab the nearest baby-names book, put on a blindfold and stabby-stab with your pudgy finger?

After some informal surveying with other writers, name generation falls in to one of the following two camps:

**The Researcher:**

<ul>
  <li>Randomly pick some names, find out what they mean and match them based on personal preference and fitness to the characters' personalities.</li>
  <li>Look for names that are popular during the time period, social-economic class, ethnicity and geography. Great sources include newspaper obituaries and the History Channel.</li>
  <li>Construct them on purpose. For example, the use of alliteration, aural patterns and tropes to create names is common in superhero and larger-than-life serials (*Flash Gordon*, *Clark Kent*, *Tom Swift*, *Dick Tracy*, *Lois Lane*, *Pepper Potts*). Try to avoid names that are explicitly tied to iconic characters like *Conan*, *Elric*, et al.</li>
  <li>Consider how people with a certain name are portrayed in other fiction. Names are usually suggestive to some degree. *Duke*, *Max*, *Buddy *and *Billy *usually denote someone of more physical prowess, whereas names like *Dexter*, *Stephen*, *James* and *Jameson* might be considered more intellectual.</li>
  <li>**Other sources:**

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

**The Muse Consulter:**

Sometimes, writers try too hard to come up with great names. Just go with your gut, because names come as they come. What you read will influence what you write.

<ul>
  <li>Think of everyday normal names or make them up on the fly</li>
  <li>Glance at the nearest newspaper, choose the first name from an exciting word, and dream up an unusual last name.</li>
  <li>Sometimes characters form with a name and vivid visual already attached.</li>
  <li>Naming villians and good guys can be colored by personal experience. If you dislike a person in the real world, you will never call your hero that name.</li>
</ul>

In the end, regardless of what you're writing, you have to believe the name--- not 'like' it, believe in it.

So, is involved name etymology a passion for you?
