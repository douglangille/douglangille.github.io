Still, I try to be <a href="http://blog.douglangille.ca/post/30313135/beliefs">respectful of others beliefs</a>, despite what can be humorous<a href="http://blog.douglangille.ca/post/37127558/brigno-riotrepublic-martin-sheen-burns-a">christian extremist</a> and <a href="http://blog.douglangille.ca/post/31578933/captain-kirk-on-atheism">atheist flame-bait</a>. In the end, it's <a href="http://blog.douglangille.ca/post/59175730/do-you-determine-your-beliefs-or-do-your-beliefs">an individual choice</a> but we tend overlook the importance of <a href="http://blog.douglangille.ca/post/77080333/teaching-human-ethics-and-simply-being-thankful">teaching human ethics</a> in the interest of not wishing to offend.

Exploring topics like <a href="http://blog.douglangille.ca/post/28375301/problem-of-evil-wikipedia-the-free-encyclopedia">the problem of evil</a>, <a href="http://blog.douglangille.ca/post/77596094/spinoza-saw-that-if-a-falling-stone-could-reason">determinism</a> and <a href="http://blog.douglangille.ca/post/28402974/todays-random-wikipedia-reading-on-religion">religion</a> is a common past-time for me especially when I'm up and about early on Sunday mornings whilst everyone else is in repose. Ah, the wonders of being a morning person!

Today was no different.

Magic tricks and benevolent zombies aside, I think there is a lot of learning to be gained by examining the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Jesus">ministry of Jesus</a> and its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_and_history">place in history</a>. Throw in some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ_and_comparative_mythology">comparative mythology</a>, the <a href="http://pentecost/">Pentecost</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumenical_council">some early church history</a> and you have the manufactured controversy for Dan Brown's next novel.

Anyway, reviewing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethic_of_reciprocity">ethic of reciprocity</a> got me to thinking about going down the rabbit-hole that is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-ethics">meta-ethics</a> as an analytical tool for understanding the human condition.

I wonder how deep it is.
