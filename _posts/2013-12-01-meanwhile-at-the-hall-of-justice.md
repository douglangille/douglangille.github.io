<img src="/assets/images/8119953873_5ffc23b7a7_hall-of-justice.jpg">So, it's been two months since my <a href="http://blog.douglangille.ca/post/62994737637/rocktober-show-me-your-horns">last post</a>. Christmas is just around the corner and soon we'll be saying 'Chuck U. Farley' to 2013.

<a href="http://themidnightabyss.tumblr.com/">*Midnight Abyss*</a> is out and well-received. Thanks to all who picked up a copy and a big shout out to those who took the time to review. We're pushing through until Christmas to see where we end up. All in all, the book has exceeded expectations. I'm not going to get rich, but I learned a lot in the process and that was my primary objective.

What's next for me? I have my own short-fiction compilation to finish editing and get out the door in a few months, then on to one of my longer writing projects. Clearly, this is more than a hobby for me.

My work with the <a href="http://www.writerscarnival.ca/">Writer's Carnival</a> community will continue in earnest, and I'm fortunate enough to be working on an exciting project called <a href="http://readerscarnival.ca/">Reader's Carnival</a>. It launches next month. Keep an eye out for that.

Work-wise, I did indeed make it to EDUCAUSE in Anaheim. I got a lot out of it, but <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=jane+mcgonigal">Jane McGonigal</a>'s talk still resonates quite strong. 'One two, three, four! I declare a Massively Multi-player Thumb War!' The campus visits were great and the Project Management seminar we delivered in Cornwallis went off without a hitch. Maybe we'll take that gig on the road.

As far as my health goes, I'm back up 5 pounds to 238. I'll blame it on travel, Halloween and spotty compliance. That puts me on track for ending 2013 the same weight I <a href="http://blog.douglangille.ca/post/39437281774/the-clock-is-running-make-the-most-of-today-time">started in with</a>. But, hey, still keeping it off and living the dream. Walking and running continues, but I've been slacking on the weights. Getting stronger is a great thing to focus on. I'm due to make an appointment with the doc to update my blood chemistry and take a gander at the remnants of my lipoma, maybe whittle a little more off the nape of my neck.

My mother-in-law's dementia continues to progress and my step-mother's cancer battle continues with chemo then radiation in the new year. Dad had a car accident, but he's okay. Mom, arguably the healthiest of the lot, had her other hand operated on and has shoulder surgery on the docket for late winter. My uncle just had his other hip upgraded to the Binford 9100. I'm sorry if I missed anyone, but, jeepers, there's a lot on the go.

On the home front, Meghan is expecting her second, making me a grandfather again. July should be awesome. Carye is working at adding to the team. Adam continues his Reign of Ossim at Acadia. I'm stoked for the <a href="http://extracttheabstract.bandcamp.com/">Extract the Abstract</a> show later this month.

My bride got herself medically hypnotized to aid in her struggle to quit smoking. I was extremely skeptical, but so far so good. The process is quite intriguing given that it is, at its core, advanced and purposeful meditation. Of course, the doctor neglected to advise that you can't hypnotize away the physical effects of nicotine withdrawal. Bastard. Those first three days were, um, interesting. She suffered but just doesn't smoke any more. That's that, I guess.

Let's have a happy and safe holidays everyone. Keep your stick on the ice.
