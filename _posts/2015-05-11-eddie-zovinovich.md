Back in the eighth grade, Pete Tomilson and his croonies ruled the hallways with iron fists. 'Zero' they called me, largely because I was smallish and kept to my own, preferring to doodle in my notebook. School bored the piss out of me. I wasn't stupid and everyone knew it. Kids left me alone and that was fine with me. Pete, on the other hand, was dumb as a fucking stump. He pegged me for a sucker only once. Thought he could hustle my lunch by tossing my book out the window. A face full of chiclets later, he learned what 'Zero' meant.
