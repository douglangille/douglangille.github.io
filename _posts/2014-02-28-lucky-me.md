<img src="/assets/images/14078381081_e9a07a4fce_leprechaun.jpg">I woke up dreaming of gold, which was weird, because I normally crave coffee. I swing my legs to the side of the bed and was shocked to fall flat on the floor. *Who made this bed taller while I slept?* I stumbled to the john cursing under my breath and caught myself in the mirror, only to see a short pudgy ginger-haired freak looking back at me. I guess I shouldn't have had that last drink at 'The Old Triangle'.
