<img src="https://douglangille.github.io/assets/images/c9c6e7c502f715c6_1280_wild-horse.jpg">I should like to be a horse,  
 So long as it's a paint, of course.  
 Flying riderless across the plain,  
 Wind tickling my flowing mane.

Splashing through shallow river bends,  
 Thundering along with all my friends.  
 Yes, a horse is what I'd be,  
 If the choice were up to me.
