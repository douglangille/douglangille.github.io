![]({{site.baseurl}}//assets/images/3789200908_9dbf327800_scrape.jpg)The water stung the cuts and scrapes along my arms. I inspected each one. Were they bites or scratches? No, just the rough and tumble bumps and bruises of a tomboy on the playground. I dried myself off and dressed in some clean jeans and hoodie. My hair was wet, but I put it up in a ponytail anyway. Practical matters.
