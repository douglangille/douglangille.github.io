<img src="/assets/images/4037536134_4d07ce228f_feathered-hat.jpg">Doug is dressed in his party best,  
 In a feathered hat and a sequined vest.  
 With an icy beer in each hand,  
 He'd rock it out, with the band.

Poker chips and tasty steak,  
 And all the fun there is to make.  
 Play the tunes, turn it loud.  
 Party hard and make me proud.
