<img src="/assets/images/IMG_20140514_121230.jpg">So here we are at the end of another month--- a busy one at that. I turned 42 and supposedly have the answer. I'm here to tell you that the question still eludes me.

But, that's really the meaning of life, isn't it? The questioning journey. The discovery. Not only of perfect pizza and the correct serving temperature of beer. Hint, <a href="http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/serve-beer-at-the-right-temperature.html">it's warmer than you think</a>. The broader 'why' is what makes us uncomfortable. Ultimately, it's unknowable. So sayeth my armchair philosophizing muse.

We take the lessons from one day and apply them to the next. Well, we generally don't, but, dammit, we should. Shouldn't we?

The month was chock full of learning opportunities that I eagerly took in. With all the project work lately, any change in perspective is always welcome. I wind up with more energy to direct at the daily work of projects and operations.

There was a one-day group seminar session on mental health in the workplace that was very useful. It featured a lot of material from the <a href="http://www.mentalhealthcommission.ca/English">Mental Health Commission of Canada</a>. The sheer prevalence and stigmas are alarming. Still, it's encouraging to be talking and learning more about it.

I attended NSCC's Festival of Learning on the 17th in Bridgewater, It's an annual internal PD thing that the college does where the topics range from technology to teaching and learning to much more softer skilled fare. I gave an abbreviated session on personal productivity using elements of Agile project management learned from JD Meier. Alas, I was between a previous speaker who ran long and chow time, compelling me to cram a twenty minute talk into ten. Perhaps, I'll get a chance to deliver it again. <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=7D392A8E543CF0B1!77334&amp;authkey=!AHvP1m6wz8ZPt00&amp;ithint=file%2c.pptx">The deck, with notes, is online for those interested</a>.

I finished that week in Truro at the Facilities Staff and IT Support conference, another NSCC event that happens in May. Outside of scaring the Bejeebus out of me with ladder safety and fall arrest, I was mesmerized by scaffolding porn. Who knew this was a thing? Now you do too. The highlight of the conference was a couple sessions by <a href="http://www.successthroughtrust.com/">Natalie Doyle Oldfield</a> on the science behind great customer service, zeroing in on trust. The resonance with Eddie's positive psychology ideas struck a chord with me. The discussion on workplace safety also twigged connections for me with the workplace mental health discussions from earlier in the month.

Tying things together is proving to be difficult. The whole month's experiences shift and arrange in my mind seeking order. In the end, learning like this is most useful in improving one's lens into their worldview.

Sharpen your saw. Adapt and react.

I finish up 'PD season' with a trip to Charlottetown tomorrow morning for <a href="https://canheit.upei.ca/">CANHEIT, a national conference for Higher Ed, IT types</a>. I always try to mix some of the soft-skill stuff with the bits-and-bytes. In the end, people are more important than things. At least until the Technology Singularity.

I, for one, welcome our Robot Overlords.

That's it. Stay agile and keep your stick on the ice.
