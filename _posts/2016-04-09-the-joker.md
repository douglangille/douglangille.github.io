"Two guys walk into a bar; the third one ducks."

No one could tell a joke like Billy. His favourite were 'dad-jokes'. I always thought he'd be a great dad himself someday. I loved how red he turned as he split a gut laughing. Sometimes he couldn't even get the joke out. It was contagious. I can't help myself but laugh right now. I'm pretty sure I'd not be alone.

But I was.

Alone in a whole crowd of friends and family, dressed in black.

God, I miss him.
