Her icy stare made me shiver  
 Even if she made me quiver

I'd close my eyes our lips would part  
 If only to melt the ice queen's heart

She leads me on, I've no choice to follow  
 My brain is numb, my heart is hollow

Across the tundra I would trek  
 For a fleeting glimpse, a tiny speck

Of hope I dare to dream in bliss  
 For one frozen and yet fiery kiss

My soul would soar to dizzying heights  
 Among snowy clouds and frosted lights

But alas, she leaves me in the cold  
 Alone wind burnt with none to hold

Cold-hearted bitch
