<img src="/assets/images/8346162027_ccd0ee6b30_b_twitter.jpg">I tried to understand it. I really did. For almost a month, I tooled around with it trying to find a reason to use it. Apparently, a cat has more cause to tweet than I do (<a href="http://twitter.com/sockington">http://twitter.com/sockington</a>).

So, I set it up. I linked it (with surprising diffculty) to my Facebook status and my Windows Live Messenger "personal message". Ta-da! Everyone could answer the question: "what is Doug up to?" I even set it up to work from my Blackberry. Now what?

Nothing. Nada. Zip. A complete and utter waste of time for me. In fact, I want that time back. No one I know uses Twitter and most use Facebook already. Between microblogging (<a href="http://douglangille.tumblr.com/">http://douglangille.tumblr.com</a>) and Facebook, I'm pretty full up on the "social web".

That is all I have to say about that.
