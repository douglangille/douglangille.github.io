He looked across the snowy plain and saw the sled make its approach. The team of malamutes pulled hard, tongues lolling outside their frozen muzzles. His friend Aguta drove them relentlessly.

The great bear shifted and it was Nanook the Man who greeted the young sledmaster. He adjusted his furs as we watched the man tend to the pack, tossing bits of seal fat to the leads. Snarls, yips and growls. They'd sort it out. Nature always did.

"Greetings, Aguta."

"We are well met, Nanook."

"You are headed north."

"To Aklavik. A delivery from Yellowknife."

"It'll be dark in an hour."

"I carry medicines. People are sick."

"You won't make it, Aguta. A storm is coming. You will lose your way."

"I have to try."

"Nanuk will guide you."

"You always do, my friend."
