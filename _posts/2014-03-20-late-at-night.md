<img src="/assets/images/Hospital_by_sheisviolence.jpg">I opened my eyes and could not see.  
 Nothing but black in front of me.  
 I lay supine upon this bed,  
 Thinking I'd be better dead.

The night nurse came and checked the dials  
 She tapped the tubes and filled the vials.  
 The salves and pills were beneficial,  
 To keep my life, so artificial.

Running in green fields, I dreamed  
 Free and happy, so it seemed  
 I panicked then, as I realized  
 I was still so paralyzed.
