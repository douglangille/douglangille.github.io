<img src="/assets/images/20090304-072552.jpg">To be honest, I'll ingest coffee in any form by the middle of the week. Sometimes, I've been tempted to take a jar of instant and eat it dry with a spoon. Good thing there's a kettle. I'd hate to see someone have to perform an "intervention" because I mainlined some Taster's Choice.

At least there is sunshine today. (It won't last.)
