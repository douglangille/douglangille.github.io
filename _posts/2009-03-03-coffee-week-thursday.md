<img src="https://douglangille.github.io/assets/images/20090305-085911.jpg">I'm in planning meetings all day that will probably feature the stereotypical coffee urn of curious vintage.

As long as it's not decaf, we'll get along.

I like planning meetings when I get to lead them somewhat (as I will today and tomorrow). They end up being very creative and conspiratorial scheming sessions with a bunch of like-minded collaborators. The group dynamic is always entertaining.

We don't actually end up plotting anything *too* malevolent.

"Insidious benevolence" is probably a more apt descriptor.
