I stared at the phone. Unknown number. *Who the Hell?* This was the third day in a row. 9am. On the dot.

11:30 creeped up and I locked my screen. The lunch table conversation washed over me as I munched, head down. *Man, kale is chewy.*

"Ain't that right, Dave?" jibbed Eric. "Dave. Earth to Dave." He snapped his fingers and Mary giggled, quickly joined by the others.

I looked up and the laughter stopped; everyone stared at me. I muttered my apologies and went back to work. Meeting-a-palooza on the docket.
