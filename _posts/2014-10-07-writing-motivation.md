<img src="https://douglangille.github.io/assets/images/262375086_e1b3d215a4_b_piano-cat.jpg">I don't want to write this post. I don't feel like it. Actually, I don't feel like writing a cotton-pickin' thing. Surely, there is something on TV? Nope. Damn. Well, there's always YouTube. Cats playing pianos. Totally cool.

Ahem. Where was I?

They keep saying that writers write. That it's some crazy addiction. A biological imperative. But what if you're just not in the mood? How can a person be bored with a to-do list as long as their arm?

Sometimes it's too easily labeled as Writer's Block--- that beastie that stomps all over your creative muse. Giving a monster like that a name can be dangerous. It's license to not reflect on what's really going on.

Are you not writing because you don't have the time? Block it off in your calendar and commit. No one has time. Writing is a part-time gig for just about everyone. Family, day jobs and life is something everyone has to balance. Not having time is an excuse. Stop that.

Are you flying by the seat of your pants? Do you have a great premise, but no plot or story? Did you just run out of steam? Maybe you should plot that puppy out.

Plotted yourself to the nth degree and now you hate your story? Roll a D20 and make a left turn. Drop an anvil on your character's head and to Blazes with the plan.

Are you tired? Get some sleep or better yet: go for a walk, then go to sleep. Feeling tired is as much about not getting enough exercise in your day. Move a little. Don't cheat on your sleep.

Eat your veggies and protein. Put that donut down. What's wrong with you? (wait, are those delicious sprinkles?) Stop eating the crap. It fogs the brain. Pro-tip: when you're tired, eat more protein not sugar.

Are there distractions? Problems in your life? Write about them. Start keeping a journal, even if you're just logging the weather and how your mood is.

But here's the real deal. Are you depressed? Give that some thought. It's way more common than you might think. If you're angry, frustrated or sad for no reason, that might be a clue. Or if you feel flat, unmotivated, and stuck in a rut, this is also depression. Sound familiar? Talk to someone.

Seriously, take the time to reflect on why you're not writing.

Oh, and drink some more water, will ya? Just about everyone is slightly dehydrated. That spongy brain of yours is thirsty.
