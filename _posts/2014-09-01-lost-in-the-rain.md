<img src="/assets/images/Storm_Drain.jpg">rain in late summer  
 the boy walks along the street  
 following a boat

*Tommy stomps in puddles wearing his new red boots as his paper craft sails the stormy gutter. Swirling ever closer to the drain, it disappears inside. He bends over in his yellow slicker to look inside the grate.*

come closer little one  
 would you like a red balloon  
 they all float down here
