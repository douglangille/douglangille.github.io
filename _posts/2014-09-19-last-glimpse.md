<img src="https://douglangille.github.io/assets/images/armagedon-6.jpg">I found the perfect spot, for us to share a final gaze  
 Of cosmic wonder, before the end of days

The stars winked brightly, and the moon rose high  
 Worlds left uncharted, above the cloudless sky

And then the lights went out, it was just you and I  
 We cuddled close, letting time tick by

The world slowed down, no more to spin  
 Tether broken, the air grew thin

Icy vapours, losing form  
 Thundering quakes, a firestorm

Hand in hand, face to face  
 We floated, our love, returned to space
