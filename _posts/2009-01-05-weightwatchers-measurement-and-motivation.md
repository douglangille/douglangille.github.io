One of <a href="http://douglangille.tumblr.com/post/20343384/doug-langilles-top-five-clifton-strengthsfinder-themes">my top strengths</a> is Connectedness (others include Analytical, Strategic, Input and Learner).

So, it's not usually a surprise when I connect the dots between completely unrelated ideas.

I joined WeightWatchers in late-November and have had some reasonable success so far --- all is good. I have a good support system and team-mates in our journey. The meeting leader at WW is very good and takes the role of facilitator quite expertly.

The conversation last evening hit home on a couple of points that I have been focusing on in my work-life.

One was on measurement and reporting --- in the program, a keystone set of habits involve the conscious measurement and journalling of nutritional information and portion sizes of whatever one stuffs in their maw.

It's metrics-based management logic:

> You can't manage what you can't measure.

But it's <a href="http://douglangille.tumblr.com/post/38071136/why-measure">Nathan Womack's chant on the purpose of measurement</a>, that really hits home.

> Measurement leads to Reporting
Reporting leads to Visibility
Visibility leads to Focus
Focus leads to Change

The other topc was on "committment" versus "interest". I was immediately reminded of the <a href="http://douglangille.tumblr.com/post/39773441/a-pig-and-a-chicken-are-walking-down-a-road-the">Chickens and Pigs parable </a>that is often used to describe Scrum Agile Development Project Methodology.

> A pig and a chicken are walking down a road. The chicken looks at the pig and says, ...Hey, why don't we open a restaurant?" The pig looks back at the chicken and says, ...Good idea, what do you want to call it?" The chicken thinks about it and says, ...Why don't we call it 'Ham and Eggs'?" ...I don't think so," says the pig, ...I'd be committed but you'd only be involved.
It's funny and makes a good point --- a better one for WW than for Agile, methinks.
