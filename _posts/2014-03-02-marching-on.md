<img src="/assets/images/IMG_00000056.jpg">So, what has been going on since I <a href="http://blog.douglangille.ca/post/72322194528/talk-is-cheap-but-rum-costs-money">posted here back in January</a>? Good question. Let's see:

<ul>
  <li>I lost 5 of the 15 pounds I gained over Christmas</li>
  <li>I didn't run much and the weather hampered my walking regimen</li>
  <li>I didn't lift a damn thing at all and we won't talk about the burpees</li>
</ul>

Health-wise, there is little else to report. Hoping for fairer weather soon. Meanwhile, I'll keep plugging away at it. I think I'll skip the Bluenose this year, but am seriously considering partnering up with someone for the <a href="http://ecoendurancechallenge.ca/">Eco-Endurance Challenge</a> on May 3rd and 4th. Am I nuts? Anyone want to join me? *crickets*

Anyhooo, it's been a surprisingly productive writing time:

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://writing.douglangille.ca/">10 new stories and 1 poem</a>. I still feel like I'm behind but I'm hitting my stride. I think.</li>
  <li>3 issues of <a href="http://readerscarnival.ca/">Reader's Carnival</a> out the door, including stories, poems, articles and photos. Learning a lot about ezine publishing.</li>
  <li>While awaiting the release of <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/dark-futures-annual-1">Dark Futures Annual 1</a>, I've finally outlined the wrapper story for my upcoming collection '*Tales from the Hanging Tree*' and have the stories selected. I'm handing the concept draft to <a href="https://twitter.com/littleonepaige">Paige</a> this week for her artistic whimsy. I expect nothing short of awesomeness.</li>
  <li>Speaking of Paige, she introduced me to <a href="http://e3chalifax.ca/">East Coast Creative Collective</a>. I'm pretty stoked to join them for a meetup on the 13th.</li>
  <li>Lots of busy-time with <a href="http://www.writerscarnival.ca/">Writer's Carnival</a>, including sparking up a <a href="http://wcwritingtips.tumblr.com/">new blog</a> with the admin team. Big-ass Post-a-Palooza event coming March 21st, 22nd, and 23rd.</li>
  <li>Working on monetizing my writing a little more creatively using Patreon. <a href="http://www.patreon.com/douglangille">What do you think?</a> I'm open to any and all suggestions.</li>
</ul>

One of the things I've had to revisit is time-management. My writing commitments no longer resemble a hobby, requiring me to block 2 hours a day to commit to Reader's and Writers Carnival on top of an hour or more daily to work on my personal writing aspirations. 20 hours a week is a substantial undertaking given my day-job adventuring in IT Management. My better-half supports this and has started a new entrepreneurial undertaking of her own called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheWoolyThimble">The Wooly Thimble</a>.

That's enough rambling for now. Gotta get back to creating chaos and mayhem. Write on!
