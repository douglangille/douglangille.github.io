<img src="/assets/images/20090301-080347.jpg">I balance lazy, affordable and tasty when I make coffee.

I use inexpensive gear that can be picked up at any grocery store or Walmart --- a grinder, a press and a kettle.

I usually try to do better than grocery store beans, but I'll happily make do as even with this compromise, the coffee is miles ahead of using pre-ground "sweepings" (although even that is light years ahead of filter drip).

I grind just before I add the hot water and stir gently with a wooden skewer. After 4 minutes of waiting, I press, pour and enjoy.

It doesn't have to be complicated or costly to have good brew.
