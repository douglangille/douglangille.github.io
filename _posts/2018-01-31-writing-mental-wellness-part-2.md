The internet is both a terrible and wonderful place. I’d been in a funk for about a year or so. I hadn’t written much and I finished even less. It was a symptom of course. I’d found myself moving into a bad head-space. Things weren’t great for me. There was a lot of stress in my personal and professional life. I was spinning my wheels. I was getting so good at failing, that I stopped trying.

At a point I was near my lowest, I discovered No More Zero Days.

A few years ago, this guy posted on Reddit about his struggles at university and life in general. You can [read the original cry for help here](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself). Another guy replied with the most epic advice ever.**[Read this now](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af/).** I’ll wait.

The result was a movement called [No More Zero Days](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonZeroDay/). It’s based on these four pillars:

1. **No More Zero Days**\
   *Promise yourself that you will do one thing every day that takes you one step closer to your goal(s)*
2. **Be Grateful To The Three “You”s**\
   *Past Self: Thank your past self for the favours they did for you*\
   *Present Self: Do your future self a favour – they deserve it!*\
   *Future Self: Your absolute best friend, and a great person.*
3. **Forgive Yourself**\
   *It’s okay to fuck up. Forgive your past self, and be a better friend for your future self.*
4. **Exercise and Books**\
   *Get your heart rate up and try to read when you can. Also the easiest way to avoid a Zero Day!*

Life is far from perfect and I still struggle in many areas of my life. I’m still not writing very much and I work hard to make my goals and the people in my life matter. In short, I’m okay.

I don’t have Zero Days. I write every day– even if only a few words in my journal. I do my very best to live in a place of gratitude and forgiveness. I move, read and learn.

There’s something else too. In[part one](https://old.douglangille.ca/writing-mental-wellness-part-1), I said living a life of grand wordsmithery can damage one’s calm. It’s important to remember it can also be a source of strength and power. I use journalling as an instrument of reflection and self-awareness. It gives me perspective. It reminds me to be grateful and to forgive. It flexs my writing muscles every day. I weave together the story of my life and of those around me. It sharpens the saw and I hone my craft.
