<img src="/assets/images/Disgruntled-Lamb.jpg">Mary had a disgruntled little lamb,  
 Whose fleece was greasy and matted  
 And everywhere that Mary went,  
 It rudely belched and farted.

It followed her to the liquor store,  
 a raincloud hung over its head.  
 Then found the cheapest lemon gin  
 That would keep their sick livers fed.

Now, Mary didn't have any money,  
 But the crusty lamb didn't blink.  
 It drew a stolen rainbow beretta  
 And they left the store with their drink.

They roasted the Bluebird of Happiness  
 On a spit over a rusty oil drum  
 While the Pigeon of Discontent  
 Laughed and passed his pint of rum.

Despair and destruction follows them.  
 If you come across them, you'd best scram.  
 Roaming the Kingdom's alleys and gutters,  
 Mary and her disgruntled little lamb
