<img src="https://douglangille.github.io/assets/images/tumblr_mhbgll9tk41rlipfwo1_1280.png">Another day down. Went to a friend's place for supper and enjoyed some tasty Mediterranean fare. I ate a little more lightly during the day to ensure that I could be comfortable with a plate I didn't prepare.

The red wine was a nice treat.

I did three circuits this morning but no cardio. No sweat though --- a 5km walk awaits me in the morning.

I hope this week's posts helped those curious about how I survive without grains and a carb/sugar reduced lifestyle.

I'm not hungry. I eat real food and plenty of it. Grok on!
