<img src="/assets/images/14761098276_7eb984183b_b.jpg">We make such a fuss out of things, small and unimportant. Money, things and status hold such fleeting satisfaction. In the wink of an eye, all these can be laid to waste. What matters, what truly matters, are experiences and how we treat each other. It is in those nuggets of joy and kindness, that we find richness.
