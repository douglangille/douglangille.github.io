<img src="/assets/images/3168158443_ce2bcc487f_earwig.jpg">I hear them, wriggling and squirming, first to my left, then my right, and then it filled my whole world with noise. The click-click-clicking of their little feet stomping and their tiny mandibles chomping--- all too much to take. I know now why they call them earwigs.
