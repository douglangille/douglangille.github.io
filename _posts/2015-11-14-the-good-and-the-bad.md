I relish the fine minutia of perfection---a blemish free polish on brass knuckles, a blade honed without sign of pit or burr, the sweet odour of ether on the finest Egyptian cotton---they're the details that matter. If only I didn't crave the chaos and blood, that last gasp and rattle and, most importantly, that final gaze of fading light from dying eyes.
