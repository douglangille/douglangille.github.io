Perseus gripped the hilt tightly and bounced lightly on the balls of his feet. He hated waiting. A growl. Finally. The sword whistled through the murky air as he pivoted to the sound, eyes closed. Athena's words guided him. Trust your instincts. Blistering heat threatened to tear away his arms, yet the blade's blessed edge carried out its intent. An impossible shriek, suddenly cutoff, and a pair of meaty thuds. Body, and most importantly, the cloven head. Perseus, eyes still screwed blind, wrapped his prize in leather, tying it shut. The Goddess would be pleased.
