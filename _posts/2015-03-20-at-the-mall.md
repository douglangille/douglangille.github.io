<img src="/assets/images/post-66098_1920.jpg">So, yeah, it all started when Mikey dared me to put my tongue on the cold post outside the mall entrance. There I stood, in my Wolverine costume on Halloween night, looking like an idiot. What made matters worse was Becky, the girl I've had a crush on since forever, came over with her friends and started making fun of me, teasing and laughing. But from out of nowhere, the quiet new kid, dressed as Hitgirl, came and poured a little water on my tongue and freed me. I turned to look at her to thank her, tears running down my face. She smiled at me and I was hooked.
