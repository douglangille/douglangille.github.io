"No mooring dock."

"What about the nearest deep harbour?"

"We use canoes. They're big, but the shoals do for us. Sure, our feet get a little torn up on the rocks and the shallow pools teem with clams. One little clam took the toe off the Chief. It was a really bad day for..."

"Are any of them on the heavy side?"

"We've been on a boat for months. We're all pretty gaunt."

"Hmmm. Maybe they'll make nice stew then."

"Stew?"
