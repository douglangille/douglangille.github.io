thin glaze on puddles  
 little girls giggle and stomp  
 ice crunches under foot

*Finally freed from him, the woman wipes the tears from her face, a bad year come and gone. She tucks the darlings into bed and steps onto the porch. Her breath frosts in the cold and the clock strikes twelve.*

fireworks blaze the night  
 painted cotton, frozen sky  
 promise a new start
