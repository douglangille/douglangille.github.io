<img src="/assets/images/autoradio-278132_1280.jpg">Barreling down the highway at dusk with the windows down, enjoying the cooling air and screaming to some rock classics on the radio.

The simple pleasures of life:

Take me down to the paradise city  
Where the grass is green  
And the girls are pretty.  
Oh, won't you please take me home.

Rocking back-to-back with:

Living after midnight,   
Rockin' to the dawn,  
Lovin' 'til the morning,   
Then I'm gone, I'm gone.

Note: cruise-control is a nice hedge against an increased lead concentration in the right foot.
