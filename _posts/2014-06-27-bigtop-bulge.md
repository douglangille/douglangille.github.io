<img src="/assets/images/8019720146_bd87339614_b.jpg">So, you see, I'm really quite worried about your health. Have you been feeling fine? Oh, healthy as a horse, you say? (I guess you shouldn't have eaten one.) Oh sorry, I was muttering to myself. No, really. You look fine in your costume. It must have shrunk a bit in the wash. Maybe you should sit this one out while we get you a new one? No, you look great. Honest. Oh, hey. Those donuts are quite stale. We do have a veggie tray out back though...
