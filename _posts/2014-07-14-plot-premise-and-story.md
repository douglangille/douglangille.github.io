<img src="https://douglangille.github.io/assets/images/7318739b107b8fcc_1280_navigation-compass.jpg">We've all been there: staring at the screen or notebook wondering how to write the middle of your story. You've built a wonderful world and crafted some deep characters. You might even have done a great job at setting the stage and have a great idea on where you want to end up. You've written down a few scenes and they are glorious. But still the flashing cursor looms.

This is what happens to pantsers, mistaking premise for plot. I am one of them. We are Legion.

Of course, Stephen King makes a strong case that plot, in and of itself, has little value. Real life isn't plotted out. What drives *story* forward is how characters grow and change within the physical premise and plot.

Start with your premise, say, *a world torn by civil war on the brink of collapse*. Next: what characters live in this world? What motivates them? *A rebellious soldier with a cruel streak, a pacifist forced into action as a field medic.* Then, upset the apple cart and create conflict and uncertainty. *Aliens attack!* How do your characters change and grow?

Redditor <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/CrownMule">CrownMule</a> offers this advice:

When plotting, don't just think in scenes. Think about what defines and connects the scenes. Think about cause, conflict, and consequence.

**Cause**: What initiated this event or decision? What is the catalyst? What is the character's desire or objective?

**Conflict**: What complicates this event or decision? What keeps the objective from being easily attained?

**Consequence**: What is the result of this conflict? What are the unintended effects or the unfortunate sacrifices?

Write your plot out as a list of the essential events (not just scenes!), including their causes, conflicts, and consequences.

And that's about all I got. Feel free to weigh-in on the topic in the comments below. Write on!
