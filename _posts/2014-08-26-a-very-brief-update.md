<img src="/assets/images/64245730.jpg">Here it is, late August 2014, and it's a busy time as always. I work at a community college. Faculty came back this week and students return the next. When I look up next, it'll be October.

Some recent happenings:

<ul>
  <li>I'm a grandfather for a second time.</li>
  <li>My story *Artemis' Nightrise* has been published in *Dark Futures Annual 1*, a short story collection. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dark-Futures-Annual-Roy-Booth-ebook/dp/B00MKA1G4W">You can pick it up on Amazon</a>.</li>
  <li>I wrote a sequel called *Nightfall in the Glade*, the first of several, that was published at <a href="http://www.darkfuturesfiction.net/nightfall-in-the-glade">Dark Futures e-zine</a> site.</li>
  <li>I did my Ice Bucket Challenge:

</ul>

Some soon-to-be happenings:

<ul>
  <li>I'll become a grandfather for a third time.</li>
  <li>I've enrolled in the <a href="http://www.3daynovel.com">3 Day Novel</a> contest this weekend. Stay tuned.</li>
  <li>I'll probably toss my hat in the ring for <a href="http://nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a>. For reals this time.</li>
  <li><a href="http://readerscarnival.ca">Reader's Carnival</a>, the e-zine I edit, relaunches as <a href="http://www.writerscarnival.ca/writing-submissions-wanted">a paying market in October</a>.</li>
</ul>

There's probably more, but that's what's on top of mind at the moment.
