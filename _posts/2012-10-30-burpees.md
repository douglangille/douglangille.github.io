<img src="/assets/images/8084682666_5244eb9f50_pushup.jpg">Healthy living and productivity can be an interesting challenge with a lot of complimentary skills --- mad ninja skills. Too bad I'm not a ninja. Yet.

<a href="http://blog.douglangille.ca/2012/10/time-to-let-go-and-play.html" target="_blank">Last month's</a> work with <a href="http://gettingresults.com/" target="_blank">Agile Results</a> was quite useful in making me more mindful of how I spend my time effectively. I'll post something longer on my approach to personal productivity another time. I have other fish to fry.

Health-wise, it was a good month. I only lost two pounds, but it was an easy two pounds. I'll explain. As you know, I've been losing weight quite rapidly since <a href="http://blog.douglangille.ca/2012/04/my-30-day-challenge.html" target="_blank">April</a> and it's always been in the back of my mind that the rate would slow as I approached a healthier weight. I did some informal research and it holds that weight loss rates, even under the most consistent of regimes, is not constant. In fact, strong regimentation will incite a plateau as the body is always seeking homeostasis. So some elasticity in approach is fundamental. I held to my plan last month but relaxed in to the 80/20 rule. I was very compliant on staying grain-free, but I indulged a bit on sugar. My overall daily carb limits were fine, but the dalliances with the sweet life has awakened my sweet tooth and I find myself craving. It'd be really easy to slide down that slope. There's a lesson here. <a href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/sugar-cravings" target="_blank">Sugar is a drug</a> and you're never really past the addiction. Back on the wagon and detox I guess. Diligently vigilant and vigilantly diligent.

Aside from eating lifestyle woes, I'm having a terrible time being consistent with any fitness activity past walking. I'm certain that if walking to work wasn't a requisite part of my day, I'd not even do that much. It's becoming a stress point in that I know in my heart and mind that this "exercise friction" is an terrible demon that must be vanquished.

While my face has thinned out quite a bit and my circumference is much reduced, I still hide a flabby hot mess under my shirt. I think it's a dirty little secret of rapid weight loss that your skin is not nearly as elastic as you'd hope. Those final weigh-ins on The Biggest Loser are all shirt-clad for a reason. It's not pretty. Beyond the vanity of it all, I have loose spots where skin touches skin bringing with it potential medical concerns that may have to be addressed. But that's a problem for Future Doug. <a href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/how-to-get-rid-of-excess-skin-after-major-weight-loss" target="_blank">Present Doug just needs to figure it out</a>. The research points to what we already know anyway. The only real way to get rid of stubborn subcutaneous fatty tissue and loose skin, short of surgery, is to exercise --- specifically, short-duration low-weight / body-weight exercise after priming the body to the fat-burning zone (70% max-effort cardio).

Damn. That keeps coming up. I keep talking about it as part of a general fitness goal. It's layered in the <a href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/primal-blueprint-101" target="_blank">Primal Blueprint</a> as well. It's not getting done is it?

Gotta get past the friction. Gotta game it up.

I was talking with some folks at work who took me up on my 30 day challenge back in the spring. One tackled burpees and the other pull-ups. They picked a starting point and added a fixed amount each day. They were very aggressive with their increments and ultimately struggled but I can learn from that.

At my current fitness level --- you may laugh --- I can perform exactly one burpee. I can do more push-ups and sit-ups  but I hate them. I like the idea of the combined effort of a burpee. It's a quick whole-body exercise. Get it done and out of the way. I also like saying the word. Makes me giggle like an 8-year-old. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burpee_(exercise)" target="_blank">BURPEES</a>!

So, for November, I'll start with 1 burpee per day, adding one to the set each day until the end of the month. That's a total of 435 burpees. For the math nerds out there: [n*(n+1)]/2, n=30.

The measurement criteria will be in body composition. Today's numbers are:

<ul>
  <li>Weight: 237 lbs</li>
  <li>Height: 5'9"</li>
  <li>Hips: 46"</li>
  <li>Waist: 44"</li>
  <li>Neck: 16"</li>
</ul>

According to <a href="http://www.healthstatus.com/">www.healthstatus.com</a> and <a href="http://www.halls.md/">www.halls.md</a>, this translates to:

<ul>
  <li>Basil Metabolic Rate: 2557.69 calories/day</li>
  <li>Body Fat Estimation: 34.44% (ideal: 15%)</li>
  <li>Body Mass Index: 35.1 (ideal: 20-25)</li>
  <li>Lean Body Mass: 154.43 lbs (ideal: 132.37 lbs)</li>
</ul>

My diet will remain roughly unchanged at 1500 calories/day:

<ul>
  <li>400 cal / 100g maximum carbohydrates</li>
  <li>400 cal / 100g minimum protein</li>
  <li>700 cal / 77g fat (no PUFAs)</li>
</ul>

I'm aiming for about 3000 calories of low-intensity cardio (mainly walking) through the week. There's a cardio element to the burpees so it'll show up here as well.

Burpees. It's worth a shot, right?
