<img src="/assets/images/4229023687_dde8b6962e_b_mittens.jpg">I hate waiting at the bus stop. It's cold out and I forgot my mitts. Jamie went back to get 'em. Tommy keeps pulling my hair on the bus. It's around the corner and Jamie's not back yet. I don't want to get on without her. She always sits beside me. My teeth are chattering in my head and I can't help it. I'm cold and I don't want to get on the bus without her. Where is my sissy? The bus pulls up with a squeak and a hiss. Mister Richards opens the door and I look back over my shoulder. He asks me to get on. I don't want to. I hear the screen door close behind me and I smile. Jamie is behind me. "Get on, squirt. Here's your mitts."
