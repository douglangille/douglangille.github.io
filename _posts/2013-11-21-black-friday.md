 To get the toy, I'd have to fight.  
 Through shopping hoards, it was in my sight.  
 I clambered over, jumped and took flight.

I knocked over puzzles under the Blue Light,  
 The objective was clear, it burned so bright.  
 Now, in jail I sit, considering my plight  
 I'll never tackle a Black Friday night.
