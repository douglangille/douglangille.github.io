<img src="/assets/images/3529592370_568f8f0490_hospital-machine.jpg">Eunice set the picture of their Caribbean vacation on the side table as quietly as she could, trying not to wake him. She brought her fingers to her lips, kissed them and touched them to the photograph before looking at the bed. He lay there silent and frozen, the machines doing all little things to keep the body going, wondering if things would ever be the same.
