<img src="https://douglangille.github.io/assets/images/Hole_y_Tree_by_flurrynight.jpg">*If you go down in the woods today, you're sure of a big surprise.*  
 *If you go down in the woods today, you'd better go in disguise.*

'Cause me and Pete play hide-and-seek, happy and fancy-free.  
 'Twas lucky I found, near the ground, a cool and rotted tree.

Inside I wriggled, and stifled a giggle, pleased with my hidden set.  
 Pete called and shouted, then he pouted, but quiet he did get.

Sun and shadow, in the silent meadow, grew dark and eerie still.  
 In the tree bark hold, I shivered cold, no warmth against the chill.

A branch then cracked, a roar, a smack, I feared for my demise.  
 For Pete, he fell, and I could tell, as I stared at lifeless eyes,

With limbs queer bent, body ripped and rent, surely he was dead.  
 His killer towered, all might and power, fur and claws soaked red.

He loudly roared, shook the forest floor, a-running came his sleuth.  
 Mother and cubs, and here's the rub, I knew the gory truth.

They started to eat, my poor friend Pete, and I began to cry.  
 They finished him, and things looked grim; I knew I was next to die.

As the cubs tugged me, from inside the tree, I madly sported a grin.  
 They tore apart, my guts and heart, but at least I scored the win.

*For every bear, that ever there was, will gather there for certain.*  
 *Because today's the day, the Teddy Bears have their picnic.*
