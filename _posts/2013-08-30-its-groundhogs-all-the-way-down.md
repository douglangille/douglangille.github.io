<img src="https://douglangille.github.io/assets/images/9600010052_80650b2bb5_groundhog.jpg">September has rolled around again. Our youngest has been delivered to university to continue his journey into Awesomehood. My bride and I are alone without children for the first time. Ever.

I'm very proud of how the kids turned out. We've done all we could do to prepare them for life. It's time to let go, because focusing on our marriage in this next era together is both exciting and a little scary. I hope she still likes me. She probably does. I think.

We each have our own friends and interests so I think we'll transition well. For example, <a href="http://blog.douglangille.ca/writing">writing short fiction</a> has really become a joy for me. The community at <a href="http://www.writerscarnival.ca/">Writer's Carnival</a> has been nothing short of amazing. If you have any inclination to scribble words on paper and just need support and a push, <a href="http://www.writerscarnival.ca">come on over</a>.

Now, I didn't post last month. It was crazy busy. I flew pretty fast and loose with my diet. I weighed in today at 238 lbs.That's up 4 pounds since Canada Day.

Up. Down. Up. Down. The scale has been stuck in the 230s for months. If I were to hold that as my only measure of health, I think Bill Murray would look like the sane one.

Things started to stall <a href="http://blog.douglangille.ca/post/36366706935/a-personal-experiment-for-september">last September when I toyed with Intermittent Fasting</a>. It probably would have happened anyway. I lost that first chunk of weight very rapidly.

Thankfully, this isn't the only measure. My fitness has improved in leaps and bounds and continues to do so. I walk, I run and I lift. I do these things not because I'm forcing myself, but rather because I have the energy to do such. That's one of the biggest surprises for me. Exercise is no longer torture and is something I relish.

When I started my <a href="http://blog.douglangille.ca/post/36366700659/my-30-day-challenge">primal/paleo push back in April 2012</a>, I adopted a 30 day challenge approach. This September is another square month that lends itself well to marking Xs off on a calendar.

So, here's the plan: I'll score an X for each day I don't have any refined food, including sugary things. That's it. I'll take a picture of my calendar at the end of the month and post it.

I track using <a href="http://www.myfitnesspal.com/realdouglangille">MyFitnessPal</a> and <a href="http://www.endomondo.com/profile/6371883">Endomondo</a> if you're interested in the details.
