<img src="https://douglangille.github.io/assets/images/6318315435_21f4f55c51_king-diamonds.jpg">My hand's all numbers so what the heck?  
 I drew a card from atop the deck,  
 My palms were wet and my cheeks a-fire  
 A chip and a chair with stakes ne'er higher.  
 My fortunes rose and I watched 'em fall,  
 As the 'Old Man with the Axe' takes all.
