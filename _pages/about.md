Doug Langille is a husband, father, writer and shameless technophile living the good life in Nova Scotia. He’s also a grandfather, bird keeper, dog owner and former cat butler.

By day, Doug fights the good fight working in I.T. at the Nova Scotia Community College. When asked to describe his work, he says: “I think stuff up and write it down.” He does other stuff too.

> I think stuff up and write it down.
~ Doug (sometimes)

Doug draws inspiration from his favourite authors, including: Stephen King, Clive Barker, Jack Whyte, Philip K. Dick and Robert W. Service.

He doesn’t usually talk about himself in the third-person, but when he does he tends to bend the truth.
